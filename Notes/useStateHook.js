// This is typically used for small state manangement and is utilized when the state needs to be utilized in a singular component. If you plan on using this state data in other places you may want to think about using Context or a stat manager. This will simplify the process and not force you to turn the state into props to pass it around to the component hierarchy.

// Code Example below 

// import { useState } from 'react';     How to import useState
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Const [state, setState] = useState();  

// This line is the state data.Name it specific to the data name and use camel case. The beginning state value is set inside of the() on the end of useState.
